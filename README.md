### What I learned

1. Evolution of Dimension Definitions : 

    Throughout the development of this frontend, I iterated on how I defined width and height for elements. Initially, I relied on viewport units (vw) for both dimensions.

2. Rethinking Width and Height Definitions : 

    After experimentation, I realized that using viewport width (vw) for width and viewport height (vh) for height yielded better results. This adjustment enhanced the responsiveness and consistency of the layout.

3. Transition Effects : 

    I explored the use of transitions to enhance user interactions. By implementing transitions, I aimed to create a seamless and engaging experience, especially when hovering or clicking on images.

4. Perceptual Feedback : 

    To provide perceptual feedback to users, I experimented with overlapping elements and transitions. This approach aimed to simulate interactions such as hovering or clicking on an image, ensuring that the transition occurred at a consistent pace.
